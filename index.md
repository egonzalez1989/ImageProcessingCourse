Nowadays an important segment in the analysis and production of contents corresponds to visual information or static and dynamic images. In problems that require image processing, it may be necessary to apply techniques for the restoration and enhancement of information, for the segmentation and classification of information contained in the image, synthesis and fusion of images of different origin.

The methods and techniques reviewed in this course will allow the student:

- Apply classical methods to improve the quality of an image.
- Apply classical methods for image segmentation.
- Apply basic image analysis and synthesis processes.
- Combine pattern recognition techniques for image classification and analysis.
- Propose creative solutions to digital image processing (DIP) application problems.
- Discuss the performance of a proposed solution.
- Discuss the relevance of using particular DIT methods in solving specific applications.
